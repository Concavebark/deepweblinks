# [deepweblinks](https://concavebark.github.io/deepweblinks) notes

First things first, if you want to be the most safe:

1. Download Tor Browser on your computer, it's the safest browser that you can use to easily acccess the Tor network//deepweb
2. Consider downloading [TailsOS](https://tails.boum.org/) and burning it to a flash drive to use as a LiveCD
3. Change your browsing habits, don't give out any information that could be used to identify you on the deepweb. **Ever**.
4. If a store site (or any website for that matter) looks shady, go around and ask people that may have used it to see if it's trustable
5. Enjoy yourself! There's a lot of info out there.

###### also don't forget to support [Tails OS](https://tails.boum.org/) and the [Tor Project](https://torproject.org/)
