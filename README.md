A list of safe deep web links for the public 

this is meant to be a repository for storing links that people can use to learn

about how the normal the deep web can be and that it's not all illegal trade and stuff.


**also note: SEARCH ENGINES ARE NOT 100% SAFE DEEP WEB, some links found from searches produced from the search engines listed will link you to Dark Web sites (illegal ones), Search Engines are listed only for giving the User a choice to search their indexed websites.**

**YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED** (asides from the [DuckDuckGo](http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion) search engine, it's a surface/clear web search engine with an onion link to ENSURE safety and anonymity)

## Read these [notes](/deepweblinks/notes) for a little bit of starter instruction!

```

the Template goes "Site Name" - "Link" (Approximation of chance to be up) [What it is]

The approximations can really be whatever phrase or word sounds most defining of the site's uptime.
